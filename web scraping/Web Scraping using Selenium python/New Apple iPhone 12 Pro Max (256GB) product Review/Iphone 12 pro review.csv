Reviewed in India on 10 August 2021,InvestBooks,Justifies the Premium Price that it deserves,"Before buying this everybody knows its premium and takes more money than a normal smartphone.
The reason for the premium cost is iPhone really long last and gets regular iOS updates.

Switched from 1+ Android to iPhone Pro Max. Used 5% full cash back using Amazon ICICI card instead and got around 6K instead of HDFC card max Rs 1750 instant discount.

Every one knows the Pros. But I will highlight few issues and Bad about iPhones.
1. Packaging was perfect. After a day of setup I noticed a small gap at the top right corner between panel and Contacted Apple support for the same and confirm its not defective.

Google' d about this and many iPhone, iPads has this gap for various/Obvious reasons.

2. No Charger and also Quick charge is not Quick (just for battery longevity).
3. App migration is easy but not smooth as switching from iOS to android
4. Still stuck with WhatsApp migration (due to WhatsApp encryption its not straight away).
5. Apple support via chat / phone is really excellent
6. Heavy on Hand and wallet :-)

Reviewed in India on 3 June 2021,Souptik Bhattacharyya,THE BEST Phone That Money Can Buy ! (coming from an Android lover),"We all heard rumors about several stuffs but at the end of the day iPhone 12 Pro Max manages to surprise me every now and then. Be it the built quality, application optimization, display, brightness, smoothness or even battery life. I have switched from Android to iPhone of late and the experience has been pretty good. The more secure platform gives you all that you need, to do serious business. You can do countless number of things on this device if you are features centric or specs oriented. Lastly, the camera module, as you all know, mqnages to deliver highest output if you want. I agree that many devices can have mind boggling numbers, bigger than this iPhone, on paper but having numbers and delivering results are two different aspects of it. If you are willing to spend this much amount of money, reliability factor comes into the picture.

I was confused whether to buy Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra or iPhone 12 Pro Max but at the end, I stick to my decision of buying iPhone 12 Pro Max. One of the very important reason of it being reliable. Buying an android might save you some bucks or even give you access to countless features but you have to think hard if you will be really needing those. I mean, don't get me wrong, we all have our own perspectives but coming from an hardcore Android lover, this opinion of mine should give you some broader view.

I know that many think that Apple is little over hyped brand but let me tell you something, it will really amaze you when you actually buy one. This is my first iPhone and I am more than just happy with the product.

Lastly, I should add one sentence to this review which is what you are trying to find all over the section.

The question coming into your mind right now is if it is worth it.

The answer is, absolutely YES ! It surely is WORTH IT.

But, you won't know if you have never experienced such stuff. So, go for it if you are thinking hard as I did.

Having an iPhone makes a whole lot of difference rather than owning an Android flagship. Android flagships lose their weight the moment next flagship is launched after a year or so, but if you are buying this phone, you can easily stick with it more than 5 years of timeframe or so what the device will start hinting you the moment you touch it.

Trust me. I was an Android lover and has regretted previously buying phones those were not.

But, the truth is that iPhones are not one of them and iOS is simply better optimized for user experience than Android. It is customer centric and not for business.",5.0 out of 5 stars,5 people found this helpful

Reviewed in India on 28 May 2021,Jack,First time iphone user review - an Android user‚Äôs perspective,"First impression: Awesome product! I mean the hardware and the overall built quality, screen display, body material etc.

Now the pain start when I need to migrate my backup of android phone. Eventually took the help of a paid app to migrate all my Whatsapp content without any hassle. Rest all the photos n videos have been migrated but in random order.

Now coming from an android phone, I find that iOS has few limitation in terms of customisation and is very basic. Moreover, a simple process of checking and forwarding a message takes few more steps in iOS than in android, making a simple task complex. This makes me feel iOS is few years behind android in developing its UI. This is the only pain point I m currently facing. Moreover, most of apps that are free in android google play store are paid in apple app store and paid ones are even more costly for iOS.

Now the highlight is obviously the camera. So far I have tested few night shots and boy!! am really impressed with the final outcome of the shots. One I have attached here for future buyers‚Äô reference. Portrait shots too are excellent. Ohh!! I forgot to mention about the inbuilt photo editing software of iOS. It has all the basic necessary tools to edit the photos then n there only. Recently, I have learned how to take a dreamy shot of waterfall with a Live camera option. Earlier that type of picture can be taken from a DSLR + ND filters on a tripod with long exposure shot. Now that shot can be taken handheld with this camera and boom!! you can make a dreamy long exposure shot in a matter of a second. Also downloaded few more editing apps such as Adobe PS express and Lightroom, and I can literally forget my DSLR and Laptop for a long time unless I require some heavy creative photography.

Lastly, battery life is very good and it lasted me whole day with my heavy uses since I need to check and learn all the time, exploring the possibilities and potential of this beast. Charging too is very fast and 80% can be achieved in 30mins; then it slow down till 100%, which is ok for me. Till date no phone heating issue is observed while charging or during heavy uses. A14 chip works smoothly without any lag or hang as of now though I have not stressed it that far to rightly comment on that matter.

Final verdict: Its an amazing product no doubt, but we in India are paying approx 50k more in taxes & duties to buy one if you compare the price outside of India - a pain point for person who looks for value for money product.",5.0 out of 5 stars,2 people found this helpful

A14 Bionic crushes everything you can throw at it with it keeping apps open in the background with zero issues. The battery lasts all day. The camera is amazing and it‚Äôs quite a big improvement coming from an iPhone 7 Plus. The screen is vibrant and the speakers sound like a good quality Bluetooth speaker. The pacific blue color is beautiful as well. Looks like grey in certain lighting. However, since this is the biggest iPhone Apple has ever made, I would recommend holding the phone in person before buying as this phone is huge & some people can find it uncomfortable at 6.7 inches. Many people can get 90% of what this phone offers in the smaller 12 Pro. That being said, if you want the biggest screen, the biggest battery on an iPhone and as long as you know what you‚Äôre getting into with the size, and you have the money to spend, would recommend this phone 10/10.",5.0 out of 5 stars,13 people found this helpful

The phone feels ultra premium in hand with stainless steel borders and matte finish back.The display lives upto the standards of Apple.Battery life is at par with last year iPhones,though on paper it has a smaller battery.Coming to the camera samples it is again the best camera in a smartphone curretly.The 10bit HDR video is amazing.They have incorporated sensor shift stabilization which I am yet to test.

Some of the pros and cons :
Pros :
Design
Low light camera shots
HDR Video
Battery life
A14 5nm bionic chip

Cons:
Price is relatively high compared to other markets
No Charging adapter(might be a huge letdown for people newly moving to iOS)
No high refresh rate displays(Although the display does not feel slow )

What I felt :
I upgraded from 11 Pro Max.For an average user you ll not find a huge difference in terms of overall usage and experience.The size might not be a fit for everyone since its really huge.I am yet to test the magsafe accessories as these aren't available on Amazon yet.So if some one looking to upgrade from iPhone XS or older ,will be a huge upgrade in terms of camera ,performance,battery life etc.

 Apple‚Äôs latest flagship makes useful advances over its predecessor in almost every way. Image quality is very good, autofocus is lightning fast and accurate, detail is high, and colors are generally pleasant. Apple remains a leader in preview performance, so what you see when composing a shot looks a lot like the final result. Dynamic range could be better, but mobile photographers should be pleased overall.

This iPhone‚Äôs weakest link is its lack of long zoom capability, something we‚Äôre seeing more of in flagships from the competition. If reach is paramount to you, then there are other phones that excel in this metric (but none that run iOS).

Video performance overall is excellent, just short of the best we‚Äôve seen. Wide dynamic range, good color, low noise, and effective stabilization make this iPhone a good choice for users who prioritize video capabilities.
