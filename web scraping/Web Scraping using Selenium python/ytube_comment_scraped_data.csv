Clay Hambrick,2 days ago,"Also in just over a minute into this video where it shows the taliban member saying they want to go to Kabul and bring Muslim law into their country nothing is mentioned about how when the taliban overtook the capital that there was an internal conflict within themselves that led to them turning their rifles and rockets on each other leaving their capital in rubble in the aftermath. Why is that people are just now asking who is the taliban? How is that Everyone wanted to pretend that Afghanistan hadn’t been in constant religious conflict and civil war for thousands of years and that the only thing keeping radical movements such as al qaeda, the taliban, and many more from doing exactly what they did within a day of the United States pulling out, was the simple presence and fighting that American forces and other allies had to do for Afghanistan’s people. Their own army care more about getting high and collecting a paycheck rather than bringing any sort of freedom or peace or retaining and protecting their homeland and freedom by themselves. The second the U.S pulled out Afghanistan’s president fled and their army threw down their guns and the taliban swept through very easily re occupying anything and anywhere they had the capabilities to do so. The taliban are nothing new?… they’ve just been waiting for the ones who are not scared to fight them to leave so they could come back and reinforce the strict radical beliefs they have been trying to install for thousands of years! And it will never change. Anyone who will take time to do research about what’s going on in the world instead of shoving their faces constantly into other bs constantly would have known all this already. I’m seeing everywhere like everyone is surprised and just learning about this issue that’s going on in Afghanistan. It really puzzles me how many people are just so oblivious to everything going on in the world",,

On August 17th 2021 which is 4 days before this comment was written,, The US withdraws all forces from Afghanistan and The Taliban take over IMMEDIATELY. There's a massive public outcry as strict Shari'a(Islamic laws) continue getting implemented. Leaders of the Taliban do an interview with a journalist and make promises to retain music, art, movies, the national soccer team and children's parks. These promises have all been broken. Music, art and movies have been banned, the children's park have all been burnt to the ground and the national soccer team is in hiding. Women cannot go out of their homes without a male escort and they cannot go to school, they cannot work or do anything that can grant them indepedence from male dominance. The president has fled the country. The United States, Germany and Britain have imposed sanctions and withdrawn all financial support to Afghanistan in an attempt to slow down the Taliban. China is gearing up to recognize The Taliban as the official government of Afghanistan. The United States congress has voted to expand visas to 19,000 Afghan citizens on top of evacuating 99 American citizens that are trapped in Afghanistan as of this moment. Mothers are crowding at Kabul airport and handing over their babies through the fence to be put on the plane so that they can be adopted by American families. More updates coming soon.",1,

The reason for this  was not shown in these visions. Whether it's a nuclear disaster area, or just something that they were told to do, people just do what they are told. No one ever goes in.
