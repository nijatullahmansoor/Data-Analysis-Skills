  It is a very good phone ..just have one concern it has a fast charger however it does not charge quickly. It take 1 hr 45 to charge from 0-100% hence it is the only one concern. Other things whatsoever is mentioned is exactly the same. Hence it is fine.

Lakshmi biju,Reviewed in India on 25 August 2021,6 month screen replacement scam by Acko,"
  The phone works well and is all good. Delivery was fine! but as in the title and rewards and promotion the phone comes with a promised 6 month screen replacement warranty from Acko. But when my phone broke and I registered with Acko, they had arranged a drop off at a nearby store for me. But when I went to the store, they had told me that had no connection with Acko. I contacted Acko multiple times and all those times they had told me that they'll some other person will contact me but they didn't it was really embarrassing to go to a store and then do all this! Will take further legal action against Acko if necessary!

  Good:The display is good with vivid colours and detailing due to the sAMOLED display.Both the primary and secondary cameras are great and can well supplement for web cameras for board displays including wide angle shots.The battery is good and lasts more than a day even with heavy web and WhatsAppusage although haven't tested it with gaming.Sleek and cool design and the cover doesn't have the plastic feel. Good build quality compared to other products in the price rangeNot so good/could have been better:Poor functionality of the finger print sensor including non availability for selfies. Need 3rd party apps for enabling the sameUI doesn't integrate well with Android fratures causing confusion to new/switch usersSlightly slow when opening Google specific apps like driveCould have done better by enabling the screen fingerprint too and screenshots are still to be taken the traditional way of pressing buttons on the side.Dual apps function is still not Fully functional and some things like files and contacts may go missing between the twin apps.If one doesn't have reservations against Xiaomi products one should go for Poco M3 instead for better functionality

  I bought this phone in July'2020..But in Aug'21(just 1 month after my warranty over), the phone suddenly stopped working(It got stuck into its restart mode where it just showed the logo and then it will not start)..First I went to samsung authorize service centre(i am not sure how reliable they are) in bangalore..They took my phone and in the evening said that the motherboard has gone and you have to pay 8500/- to repair it..I am not sure wheather they did any check or just random say this..Now there is no point to invest around 70% of total amount for repair which will provide me 3 months warranty.Then I checked with 3/4 local shop owners and they said that this is the common problem with samsung(specifically M series which sold online).So guys be aware!!! Dont go by the SAMSUNG brand name.Take your decision wisely,becuase it is your hard earned money...**Btw i am not a heavy mobile user..i use my mobile mainly for check email,call and sometime for watching some series on OTT platform..

I use my phone in a medium range - Some browsing, gaming and music. Even with medium usage, a full charge lasts for 2 to 2.5 days.2. Camera - Camera quality is very good. Make sure to use 64MP as it is not default in 16:9.3. Performance - I play CoD and the performance is good. There is no heating issue as well.4. Build quality - I have used spigen rugged armour case for my phone and it holds the phone very well. I had dropped my phone face down 4-5 times, but not even a scratch on the screenCons:1. Back of the phone is little slippery. If you use a case then this won't be an issue for you.

  Worst phone... Please do not buy... This is my second Samsung phone in last 21 years and both Samsung phone was waste... This has antenna problem... The call will stop coming and the person calling will tell you afterwards that the automated Voice says number you are calling is out of coverage area.. which you're not... Suddenly you won't be able to call anyone then you need to restart your phone... I believe the low range phones are not good in Samsung to buy..

  I personally don't recommend Samsung to anyone in my life time. I bought this phone 1 year back and it was really super to use, camera quality everything was fine.  But exactly after 1 year Samsung pushed an software update after a week my phone was total gone. It just shutdown frequently and stopped working. When I visited Samsung service center, they had a nice answer as phone warranty was over, it is 1 yr 1 month now. Motherboard issue so you need to spend around 10k to change. This is my second Samsung phone exactly the same issue. Please don't buy Samsung or just a have thought if anything happens after an year you should forget about Samsung support and spend your own money.

  I am pretty much disappointed with M31. Bought the phn on 6th aug,2020 and just after 1 year and exceeding the warranty period (17th aug,2021) it is getting automatically restarted within every 5-10 mins. Even in the safe mode, after factory reset and software change it is giving same problem. Service center people asked me to replace the mother board of this almost new phone, which costs 7000 rs.They asked me,why I did not buy extended warranty. Please avoid this product of samsung. There are many videos in youtube,which shows this problem and provide solution,which does not help unfortunately but I am trying to say this is a genuine problem for this product. PLEASE IGNORE THIS PRODUCT.

  Writing review after 4 month. Mobile stopped working after 4 month. touch panel is malfunction. weird thing is 4 hour before touch panel stopped and after charging i notice that screen color started spreading. this happen when mobile is drop but in my case, mobile is not dropped and still it's happening. I faced similar malfunction in my earlier Samsung phone which last for 13 month and this one worst than that. Do not buy this model. looks like Samsung is reducing quality. My 3rd last phone (which also Samsung) was with me for 4 years and I changed it for phone memory size.Samsung service center claim that device is damage without opening it. They are good.I like to say goodbye to samsung as I am not going to purchase any more samsung phone. I used multiple samsung phones in last 12 years but phone quality is dropping and hence I am going to stop buying samsung phones. Worst product.

Service center people they are saying it's an IMPACT DAMAGE,Means if your phone has no phisical damage then it is called as an impact damage. What is this? They are arguing that  even if you kept your phone in your pocket and walk or run it might cause imapct damage. Kya bhat hai,Please help us Samsung. how should we use our phones without keeping in our pockets?This is not way to earn money Samsung.Service senter is now charging 4700/- for screen replacement.While other brands like Nokia they are replacing screen for free on any internal screen damage for one year.

Nabo Barman,Reviewed in India on 19 August 2021,Unrealiable and worst mobile ever purchase. Please Avoid Purchasing this Mobile.,"
  Purchased Samsung M31 (128 GB storage and 6 GB RAM configuration) mobile on March 2020 from Amazon. It was a new release by Samsung with exciting and lucrative features at a budget cost of 16000. I was using the mobile in a nominal manner for regular usage without any gaming application. It was working perfectly alright until July 2021. However, the phone abruptly stopped working after 1 year and 5 months without any accidental damage. The phone was only able to display the Samsung logo and I was unable to either switch on or off the mobile. When contacted samsung care they said that motherboard need replacement and they quoted price around 10000. Meanwhile, warranty was expired and its not worth to go for such costly spare part replacement. Data was lost and caused undue harrasment to me. I was previously using Apple, Lenovo, Nokia, and Motorola mobiles. However, this is my first worst experience from a reknowned mobile brand Samsung. When I contacted the mobile repair shop he said many users have similar problem with Samsung M series phones and asked to avoid purchasing the Samsung M series phones. Features are nice but durability and reliability is very poor.

The 2 points taken are for the slow charger, no back case and a pre applied screen protector provided which leads to an extra purchase expenditure... A worth buy in 2021 as well

Now they are saying it has issue in motherboard and now i have to replace the motherboard for that they are charging at an around 9000. my only concern is that if they know that it has motherboard issue then why they are waiting till warranty get expired, they have to replace at that time.The life of product is only 1 year not more than that if you want to buy for one year then go for it otherwise if you want for long term do not buy this product.

Aritro,Reviewed in India on 11 August 2021,Very bad. Should have never bought it.,"
  Should never buy midrange of samsung. Not just this M31, but all the models of M series have this same problem. They promise big battery life with 5000mah 6000mah or 70000mah battery but just after sometime, the battery becomes so weak that it doesmt feel like it has big battery.The software becomes sluggish, phone starts freezing after finishing call, or even opening whatsapp and also sometimes it freezes while in lockscreen and you have to hard restart your device. If youhave even a slight moisture on your fingers the screen and touch gets paralyzed, something which not happens often with other company phones. Unlocking with fingerprint sometimes doesnt even work if your fingers are dry and placed well on sensor then also. Camera quality simply drops after software updates, they trick by saying they giving fast charger but its never a fast charger. Really bad experience. Thought samsung worked on itself but I was wrong. Really pathetic mobile company. Im never gonna buy samsung again.

The only solution  at service center is to have the mother baord changed which will cost half the price of new phone ( around  Rs 7800)Even the after market repair shops openly accecpts they  get many samasung  A and M serries customers  who have thisss issue, and this  issue cannot be resloved by them and  the  phone  is useless  and no person/shop / or  old  phone pruchaseing  compny will buy it for  Rs 1000.DONOT  PURCHASE THIS PHONE.

Ashutosh,Reviewed in India on 10 August 2021,Samsung like Chinese phones are not trustworthy.,"
  This review I m writing after 1 year of M21 and M31 use.M21 :- As Samsung is famous for worst experience in phone after a year, is actually true. Last month, July, my M21 phone completed 1 year and this month it stopped working. This phone was used only for 20min - 30min calling everyday, an hour or two on FB and 5-6 hrs (in chunks) on candy crush. Phone doesnt even start now, it is stuck at Samsung logo.M31 :- 6Gb ram. I really think many a time, that my desktop with 4gb ram is much faster then my phone. Same last month it completer 1 year, and now it hangs like a 30 year old phone. Wifi range for this phone is max 6-7 meters. I had to play online games sitting next to the wifi router. Same with the phone network internet, it will disconnect continuously as u would be holding phone from both the sides while playing.Conclusion: Looked like new Samsung phones would not have 1 year issue but its their legacy and will continue, so plz try not to take any phone from Samsung.Like me who doesnt want to go with chinese phone so opted Samsung, plese ping me also the alternatives.NOTE: It took me 45min to write above comments with this super fast (dubba) phone.

Dee Ravi,Reviewed in India on 10 August 2021,Going for iPhone thanks to Samsung quality,"
  I have been using Samsung mobiles since last 6 years and last year I bought this m31. My earlier Samsung on Nxt mobile used to hang a lot and I thought all my problems are resolved when I bought this m31. Although it worked smoothly in the initial days, the mobile started hanging after couple of months. And last week, it started restarting every 10 minutes. I took the mobile to nearest Samsung care and they said that it’s mother board issue and motherboard will be replaced in 10 days. All my important data is lost. They don’t care about that. Samsung has compromised with quality in the recent years. I finally thought that it will be better if I switch to iPhone. Although costly, you need not bother about phone crash, data loss for at least 5 years. It’s a one time budget for me. My colleague is also complaining about the battery issue in Samsung m31 which he bought 6 months ago. My other problem with m31 is that there is no voice clarity whenever you receive a call. It’s very irritating after spending 17k on a mobile and you get cheap quality. Beware users. Samsung is not the best now a days. I bought Oppo A5 for my mother and it is really better compared to Samsung. So I’m finally moving out of android after 10 years all thanks to Samsung. Welcome to IPhone.

Am 'azon Cust 'omer,Reviewed in India on 8 August 2021,Samsung spam,"
  Samsung forces you to accept their ads and spam and it gets worse with every software update. The previous update had a persistent notification that couldn't be swiped away asking me to activate ""Samsung services"", which basically means accepting ads on my lock/home/app screens. This notification would've sat there nagging me until I decided to yield.So I emailed Samsung support, who said that if I restart my phone, it'd go away. Kudos to them: it did!Yesterday's software update 'fixed' that issue. Now Samsung's spam notifications don't go away on a restart, and are stuck at 'Allow' in the settings.There's other ways Samsung tricks you into accepting their ads, for instance by hiding the 'no' option in various places. Point being, this sours the entire Samsung experience for me.The hardware's decent: fabulous screen, ok processor, crummy speakers. The screen itself is worth the asking price. OneUI (Samsung's version of Android) has some good ideas that vanilla Android has now copied (as it should). But when I decide to buy the next Hi-Fi or TV or smart fridge or phone, it won't be a Samsung. That's because to me, now, Samsung = Spam.

Splendid battery life of 1.5 days given the heavy usage (mobile hotspot for wifi connection 12 hours/day).3. Samsung representative called to enquire about the phone, its functionality and overall performance. I think its a good approach by the company.Cons1. Post updating the android version to 11 with One UI Core version 3.1, the call quality diminished. Got the issue fixed with great difficulty. Not sure if I'll update the phone software again.

Bhushan Kumar,Reviewed in India on 7 August 2021,Do not expect even a day life if you take your phone to Samsung Service center.,"
  My day at #servicecenter of #samsungelectronicsThis was the very first time that I ever visited a service center in my life and ended up with huge #disappointment.  Since it was #brand #samsung , I went with the hope of a fair #aftersales #customerservice journey but my #personalexperience changed the way I used to perceive the brand and it's products and #values.I bought #samsunggalaxy smart phone on 7th Aug 2020. On Saturday, 31st July 2021, when the phone was still under warranty, my phone had some charging issue. So I visited the service center of #samsungelectronics in  #gurugram (Advance Technology ‐ 0008201519). Here are my observations and experience.1. Problem of changing in phone was fixed on Saturday but my Phone's half display turned black by next day end.2. In my 2nd visit on Tuesday, I met the officer  again and complained about the display  problem.3. Instead of fixing the issue instantly, Customer care officer (Gourav) blamed me for the damaged!! Also I was told that the repair will be chargeable and doesn't cover in warranty.4. I was not given the service receipt for Jack changed. Upon asking for receipt I was denied that receipt is never issued for Jack change.5. It was so unfortunate to see Customers screaming and fighting with service center team last Saturday. Within 2 hours of my waiting time I saw 4 different fights with customers and one was a #seniorcitizen. I felt so bad about that gentleman and service center team treated so badly to them.6. After watching those fight and in order to secure an evidence I recorded a video of Customer care officer where he accepted that Charging jack was changed and no receipts are issued for that and later denied when he got to know that video is being recorded. I Do not want to make the video public at this moment but can share it officially to Samsung team if needed.7. I felt being #ditched and #cheated after the entire incident. I am 100% sure that they tempered the screen of my phone which started giving me problems hours after the repair. There is strong #unetical and #fundamentalproblem with the service center team.8. Instead of spending millions on #brandbuilding you must spend on good quality after sales service which makes it lasting experience. Spending another 25k - 30k on new device is not a big deal, but definitely not at the cost of #unethical behavior. I wish I would have changed my decision to go with #appleiphone before.9. Stop talking about preventing #ewaste in your #csrinitiative, as unethical after sales service is one the biggest reason for e-waste dump. Customer are left with no other choice but to dump their devices in bin after being #cheated.10. Hope my massage deserve some respect and expecting for a call back from #greviance department

But I would say this is my first and last buy of Samsung.I bought and gifted it to my mother in June 2021. And phone's screen is not working and  this is August 2021. They assured me to replace it but that doesn't mean manufacturing of such brand is of so low quality.Not happy with the product.

  I am writing this review after using the mobile for 13 months. Initially it was good, but after 8 - 9 months battery became weak, and now if you use it for normal net surfing for 3 to 4 hours,  you have to charge it again. And note that I never play any games in this mobile,  just normal use as Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube average 1.5 hours per day. And now suddenly the phone starts auto restarting and stops working. Service centre guy says its mother board has gone and it will cost 8000 approx. And after staying almost 2 hours in service centre, I noticed that almost 30 phone came with same problem and service centre suggesting everyone for changing motherboard. So it is clear that Samsung is using very low quality parts in their smartphones. Even 15 months old rs30 thousands phone ( l can't remember the model number) has same problem. So guys think twice before investing your hard earn money on Samsung smartphones. I am suffering. So if you invest then also invest in extended warranties.

Yesterday I have visited Samsung service center (5th of August 2021). because of Mobile automatically restarted and showing Samsung logo. Not able to operate. The service center lady told me it's a mother board issue. It's a out of warranty it will be charged Rs. 8500/- and after service you will get 90 days warranty only. Just for 3 days of warranty lapse they won't ready to give me a free service. And service charges is very high. I suggest you plz dont purchase this M series Mobiles.

  I brought this on Amazon close to a year back for my sister.  The warranty expires on Aug 2021.The delivery by Amazon as expected was Prompt and on time.Suddenly one fine day(Not even a year since buying) the display stopped working.Now comes the worst part of allContacted Samsung service center, customer care on this. All they have to say even without listening to the customer is this issue is due to manhandling and service center has the audacity to even say that one should see the warranty guidelines before buying the product(where screen display is not covered under 1 year warranty)Samsung customer service SUCKS!! have escalated this to the customer grievance cell in Samsung. Even they don't care to RESPOND.So after paying 17,499/-(at that time) for the Phone, one should not look at the Brand name ,nor the customer service, nor the Trust factor. one needs to bother is how the warranty is covered for each phone partThis is the message i got after the interaction with Samsung Customer care and Samsung Service center.Once you buy the phone you are at the mercy of these people and end up paying half the price of the Phone or  maybe even moreThink twice before falling PREY to such gimmicks. No value for money.There are better reliable mobile Brands/Models out there in the Market which are good and trustworthy

  The product is worst. The power IC of this phone got damaged in one year. This problem is very comman in M series phone said the person who repaired my phone. I spend almost Rs 1500 and within 2 days the same problem occured again. So I suggest to ignore M series mobile.

  Beast!!WHAT I LIKED-Battery-lasts more than 2days,6000mAhCamera-10/10(loved the macro lens)No laggingPhone charges 100% in 2hrs 30mins.Exynos 9611 good performance play these games like Call of duty but not on extreme settings (it will lag)WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE-The one and the only thing which i didn't like was the polycarbonate glossy back panel of it,i had the same back panel in one of my other phones and it just kept on attracting scratches all over the back panel.So Cover is a must necessary thing for it.

  Fingerprint reader: it's been a month since I bought the phone and finger print reader having issues. It struggles to sense the finger multiple times and after 3 or 4 trails, it works. Further , you need to recreate the prints again to make sure it works for another couple of days and the pain reappears.Battery: it takes 3 hours to full charge . Despite the statement of fast charging, it does come with 2 A charger that charges at the same rate as the other phones. But the battery back up works well. It comes close to 2 days on medium use. With video calls, mostly  a day.Camera quality: awesome. One thing that impresses to the core is its camera quality.Display: awesome.

  While the M31 has pretty good features, the screen glass is extremely delicate and broke on the very first fall from the hands of my wife from barely a height of 3 feet when she was getting off a sofa ! 2 cracks at the first fall at home ....................

manjunath,Reviewed in India on 26 July 2021,Travel adapter not working,"
  Well, I wanted to buy good camera features and screen. Then I decided to buy Samsung M31. Even though, product was not in stock, they were taking orders. Product delivered to my city after 7 days of ordered date. Then With full joy, I opened,turned on and kept phone for charge. After 1 hour, I opened and shocked that it has same charging percentage. Then I came to know that Travel adapter was not working. So finally with help from Amazon team, I returned this product. Now I will choose other branded phone.

  I bought Samsung M31 start of this year. Suddenly I'm facing display issue. A black dot surrounded by pink color and pink color area keep on increasing. There is no physical damage in my phone. I went to Samsung  authorized service center immediately. Service center guys simply cancelled my warranty replacement  of display. The reason for the damaged from customer service center guy told to me ""It's a physical damage and will not come under warranty. You have pressed the display hardly due to that LED cells are damaged"". Even though I pressed the display then screen should have some physical damage right ?. Correct me if I'm wrong. I do see few people came to same service center with same issue like mine. There is big question on the quality of the Samsung.

  I am writing this review after complete 1 year 25 days and now this model of Samsung phone started showing it's originality. The problem started with locking of phone for complete 24 hours, as I truly trusted Samsung I waited for 24 hours and after that phone started restarting again and again. Never expected this from any Samsung phone but really wrost phone with M series mine is M31(6GB,128GB) now I am unable to make even a single call. I tried all possible approch mentioned on Samsung help support but the issue still persist.This phone having a major software bug which is not going even after multiple software updates. Now the only solution after waisting 16500 on this phone is to give extra charges to service center or 2nd option to buy other phone. I am really feeling like cheated.

They are trying to sell me extended warranty which I might buy because now I am stuck with this.The problem was sound. They rebooted it, which is a headache we all know.Later on I have come to know from others that Samsung phones have sound issues, I don't know if it is true for others but is true for me though.

  We had purchased it last year. Just before 1 year end suddenly last week the phone got hang/stuck on boot screen (STONED) and we could not do factory reset. Luckily for us our warranty was active and took it to Samsung gallery. It was motherboard issue and motherboard was replaced. Lost all data (photos, videos, etc). Gallery was prompt on service but if warranty was not there it would have been costly affair almost INR 8k. Phones are very delicate and not sturdy. I have used Moto for more than 4 years even Honor phone they never required repair we changes because we wanted new. Though service experience was good and now phone is as good as brand new. I say build quality is important. Samsung is delicate!

When I went to the service centre they said that this issue is common with M31 devices. They also said that it would cost around Rs 8000 to get the device repaired. Just think about it, spending half of the money for which you bought the phone to repair it. Also the Samsung customer service is the worst one ever. Really disappointed.

  I purchased this Samsung Mobile M31 in March 2021. After a few weeks the display failed. The Service centre refused to repair, claiming it has no warranty (because it was purchased from Amazon). Somehow we convinced it is under warranty and they repaired. A few weeks later it does not receive SMS. Now it does not recognize SIM cards. Can't even make a call or receive. You have to waste hours to get a connection to Customer Care number. I tried chat. The same thing. After a series of questions, they suggested so many things - restart, trying the SIM on a healthy phone, settings, safe mode...Nothing worked. Then they allotted a token number for Service Centre repair. After 2 days, the Service Centre closed it without our knowledge. Then again I did all over again. The token number is given again. Nothing has happened. I wrote email to the Customer care. Assured action. Nothing so far. Those who want to purchase this phone or any Samsung phone, read this carefully. The Service Centre telephone numbers given in Samsung website does not work. I have asked a replacement for this defective phone, but no answer yet.

  I Presented Samsung Galaxy M31 to my mother. Writing this review after 6 months of usage. Battery life is too good. Sound is fantastic. If you are a selfie lover, then this mobile is not for you. Poor camera quality. Cannot zoom in selfie mode. Even back camera also not that much good. You can satisfy with the fact that you have purchased a branded mobile. Apart from this nothing special. In my perspective, it will be good, if someone above 40+ is using this mobile as they don't usually use too many features.

Samsung wantedly manufacturing defect in motherboard because it costs upto rs.9000 to replace new motherboard. They are cheating by giving with good specifications but less cost. In 1year 3 months motherboard problem arised . Not only to me , same problem to my friend also . Many samsung  M series  mobiles are facing this motherboard failure since march . You can check in TWITTER about this issue . SO DON'T BUY SAMSUNG M SERIES PHONES . BETTER DON'T BUY SAMSUNG MOBILES . EVEN samsung serivce centres are also saying to buy new phone other than repacing motherboard. I HOPE THIS REVIEW MAY USEFUL TO YOU.  This review is After usage of 15-16 months.

The battery inspite of it being 6000 mAh lasts only  for one day with moderate usage. Overall a good phone but could be priced a bit lower at around Rs. 15000.

  (Honestly)  AMAZING..! JUST GO FOR IT..!CUZ,  BRAND IS BRAND..!I had many other options for smartphones, but I love samsung so I bought this. Samsung m32 has just launched even then I bought this thinking that rather then spending 17k on that I can get 8gb ram, 32mp front cam, bigger screen and amazing look. I wonder why There were so many bad reviews on this product but I didn't care about that. I got it and I am absolutely amazed by the PERFORMANCE, CAMERA QUALITY, DISPLAY QUALITY, FINGERPRINT.I really don't Need to unlock by finger because when we take the phone in hand and press the power button it get unlocked in fraction on seconds you don't even realize how and what happened.This phone is really wonderful, this is my honest review.

  Bought this phone in Aug-2020.Display not working in July 2021. Expectations were high. Samsung disappointed.Looking at the crowd at Samsung Service Center shows the quality of their products. It is a parallel business of spare parts. They refused to repair the display in warranty by the way. Should have chosen another brand.

sarvalakshmi,Reviewed in India on 9 July 2021,Samsung customers support is very poor don't trust the warranty,"
  I bought the phone in December 2020, it is only 6 months now. The phone stopped charging, though the phone is under 1 year warranty. I contacted the samsung customer care and they had arranged to pick up my phone after making me pay Rs.200 for pick up and drop charge. They had assigned it to some random repair shop who after checking the phone demanded me to pay Rs.1200 for changing the charging pin saying the warranty is over. When I said I have to contact the Samsung team to get clarification he challenged me saying wherever I go he will make me pay. Then after reaching the customer care I came to understand that the repair shop has wrongly reported the issue as touch screen issue to the Samsung team. Though I have explained the situation nothing has been done from Samsung and my phone is at the service center only god knows whether I will be able to see my phone in good condition back again as it is left with the mercy of the repair center. Samsung does not have proper service center and the warranty is meaningless.

  Samsung mobile are worst. If you want to buy Samsung then go for premium product because for mid range the quality is not good. Before one year my mobile got motherboard problem and the service center ask me to pay 9k. The service center are just for making money. I ask them, still my mobile is under warranty. But they are telling me that it's upto them to decide whom to give free service. I had a Worst experience going Samsung service center.

I stopped charging and to my surprise, heating was not limited to charging . It’s heating even while using simple application like Facebook.Amazon has been unhelpful as I try to get this replaced.They have scheduled multiple so called  technicians visits. The technicians visiting are 3rd party vendors who just care about getting money per visit and don’t care about fixing the issue at all.I’m left with a new phone that heats to dangerous levels and is uselessDon’t buy this phone

Camera is okay, but one can get much better in lower range mobiles of other companies.4. Connectivity issue: I inserted both 4g sim but the connectivity of both the sims for internet is inferior (despite all correct setting). The same sims works perfectly in my 5-year-old Huawei device.I never recommend buying this. I want to refund; please help.

A deeply dissatisfied customer,Reviewed in India on 3 July 2021,Can't be covered in one line,"
  Bought this phone a year ago. Worked fine and was worth the money. After the April update, the phone went to hell.Firstly there was the bricking problem,  when that was solved,  I am now facing the issue of the phone hanging and restarting at the most random times.Dont even get me started on the keyboard. Damn thing stops working so frequently, people think I sleep in the middle of texting. I can bear it once in a while but this happens multiple times everyday!I tried to use this for games like COD but the phone heats up like it's about to explode in my face, so I deleted any heavy games. Doesnt make a difference in the disappointing performance though. Now even using apps like Instagram and WhatsApp traumatized this phone and it restarts on its own.I expected better from Samsung. I'll be going for another brand when this phone finally goes to its grave (wont be too long, honestly).

  This is worst product, I have purchased. Even after paying premium for brand, the after sale service is worst. For last one month battery is dead and customer care says check your adapter, cable, power connection but does not repair or replace fault product. There are numerous similar complaints on Samsung member site. Check that before you decide to purchase Samsung product. It is worst than Chinese peers.

  1. It didn't measure data speed. It won't give data consumption during a day.We have to download an external app which don't work accurately.2. Phone is hanging THOUGH IT IS 6 GB RAM.Taking screenshot is very difficult.  Don't know why Samsung is making things very difficult.3. Camera is fine. I used nite 8 pro before. I can't declare that m31 is not better than note 8 pro in terms of camera.4. UI is very unfriendly.  There are so many options in settings,  many of them are useless.5. I used basic realm (3i) phone of my father (unused data). It used to download things fast.  But m31 is not able to catch up the speed .I am very sad. I shouldn't have bought it. As Samsung is non Chinese phone,  I bought it. I shall go for some other phone..4.

   Please don't purchase any mobile from this seller or from Amazon. As they have lost credibility. The phone stopped working within 1 month and when I asked for a replacement they said your return window is over. I checked with Samsung Service Center and confirmed that It had a manufacturing defect. Lost trust in Amazon who started looting the people to provide the defective product at the original price.If this defect has not caused by me then why should I use the product after repairing it while I paid the money for an original phone? Please stop making fools.When I questioned this to customer care, they said I should stop purchasing at Amazon and look for another place. This is the rude behavior of Amazon I have ever seen since when I started shopping at Amazon in 2014.

It fired my postpaid SIM as well and had to get a new SIM.Raised request with authorized Samsung service center(Complaint No# 2310403157) and they said that motherboard is corrupted and it would cost 8000 INR to get this fixed.No proper explanation was provided how come a device in perfect condition stopped working without any mishandling.Do not waste your money with Samsung smartphone.Worst battery backup, pathetic camera quality and useless interface and that too bundled with disastrous service record and repair cost.All the best!

On day when I was playing Pubg suddenly I saw a pink and purple patch on the screen . I reached to Samsung authorized Center and they said it's not covered under warranty. They were asking for 5k to replace the display. I'm totally frustrated.Don't believe my word, just go to the Samsung community forum you'll find hundreds of complaints of the same.The same issue with M31s also.

Post that, there was an overheating problem wherein within 5 mins of usage, it would get so hot that you can't even hold it in your hands.

Need bigger processor or less storage.Flash light heats up at full brightness hence need to keep it 2nd or 3rd level max so that safety glass doesn't fade yellow soon due to heat.Thumbs up to battery, enough for almost two days as per my usage. Means, after my 9 to 5 job I can watch 2 movies and still I can go along till 4 PM of next day.Camera is fantastic.Phone is quite handy.Over all average phone.

TT,Reviewed in India on 12 June 2021,Poor quality phone and components.,"
  Horrible. Less than 9 months old. Display looks like this. Never faced this with any other phone. Searched on the internet, I see multiple such complaints for the display for Samsung phones. Will never buy a samsung again. It appeared as 3 small dots at the bottom left corner of the screen, in less than 2 days it looks like how it's in the pic attached.update: Took it to the service center, Post lockdown relaxations, Service guy explained that there is a small crack on the screen(glass on top - gorilla glass 3?) hence the warranty will not cover it. the gorilla glass broke in a month, but the display discoloration happened after 6-7 months. The service guy accepted that the issues are different but as per policy it will not be covered under warranty. he said change in display will cost me 4700. didnt opt for it knowing fully well that the new display may not last long either. Searching amazon reviews, I find a lot of phones with the exact same issue - so its a Samsung known issue which they refuse to cover under warranty!!!!

Roy M.,Reviewed in India on 12 June 2021,M31 Phone Stopped working in just 11 months,"
  NEVER BUY THIS PHONE.When using Amazon App, the Galaxy M31 phone, just crashed and it went into an infinite boot screen loop.The phone did not start after that. The phone is given to Samsung service center and they informed they might need to perform firmware re-installation which causes all data to be erased. So not only my phone, but all all of my precious data is gone now. I studied the problem and found that, for Samsung phone, it is a common problem.So don't buy Samsung phones. It offers zero data security. Google ""Samsung Phone Stuck in Boot Loop and Wont Turn On "" and you can find lots of such issues regarding Samsung phoneOne component of the phone is damaged and the Customer Service center replaces it ( it took a long service time of 3 weeks). I LOST ALL DATA IN MY PHONE during the repair process.

  Within 10 days, Sim Card Not detected, Pathetic, Due to lockdown, couldn't access service center, i reach Customer care through my friend mobile, they couldnt help me in anyway. I dont have alternate mobile for my sim card. Amazon Return window also closed. 15000 junk phone was in my pocket without any clue. Due to this mobile , i couldnt reach my team for meetings, once i came out of office, i cant reach anything, all OTP are linked to my simcard, but it was inserted in useless mobile. Thanks Samsung and Amazon for awesome product..

Rohan,Reviewed in India on 10 June 2021,One of the finest product of Samsung,"
  One of the finest product of Samsung sold on Amazon. No need to write on product description. (6GB/128GB variance)But coming to its pricing, I remember M31prime launched in March 4, 2020  with almost similar configuration that of M31 (launch on 26th February 2020). Pricing was Rs.12999/- with 10%SBI discount to almost Rs. 11,699/-. Currently in Jun21 Redmi 10 Pro is selling their product near to 14500/- after discount,  I think this is the right time for Samsung to lower its price from 14,999/- and make it near to the old prices. So many people are asking me which one to buy in current Indian scenario. And I am suggesting Samsung M31 compared to Redmi. Though Redmi has few seconds of better speed. Samsung camera / picture quality is far better then any other phone.

  Well, I was using Nokia 6.1 plus 6 GB for last two years and I was searching for a phone within 15K with similar or slightly better phone. Unfortunately all phone are now close to 200 gram, so big that you can not handle in single hand and all are FAT. And specifically I do not need any super file camera at all. If there is any phone without the selfie camera that should be okay for me. Finally I had no other option within 15K other than Samsung M31 and Samsung F41 and choose M31 because of the back side look.Performance - GoodCamera - very GoodBatter - Good till nowFinger Print - AverageToo many installed app from Samsung - Don't likeGame installed  - Don't likeFace Unlock - Never tried, may be will not try

  I purchased the phone in Jan 2021. After just few months of use, there was  pink color spot on my phone. Day by day it started spreading to the whole screen. While my phone is still under warranty, Customer care says the damage to the screen was due to my fault and the screen replacement cannot be covered under warranty.It seems that even slight pressure on the display will cause damage. This means, you cannot carry the phone in thight pockets which is ridiculous.I would not recommend anyone to buy this product

Has good storage(both RAM AND ROM), battery life, biometric sensor under the budget.Yeah it takes 2hrs to get fully charged.I would give 3 out of 5 for packaging. The bill was messed up inside the box. The products were safe only because samsung itself have separate packaging before I placed the order.

  - I bought this mobile 2 weeks ago and got the mobile delivered the next day itself and thanks to Amazon.- Trust me guys, I'm very impressed with its performance and battery pack up is superb and it lasted for me more than a day after even after watching a movie in Prime and googling all social media. Screen resolution is very impressive and it also has the option to record 4K video but I haven't tried yet.- If you want to experience Dolby Atmos, then this is the perfect mobile under 15k and I enjoyed the music effect with a unbranded earphone and I guess the effect would be more good if we go for branded Headphones. Also we can feel the Dolby Atmos in full only in wired headphones and not with a Bluetooth headset completely.- Selfie camera with 32 mp is really good and very useful for video calling.- Only thing I am disappointed is it does not have a Screen recorder app and also the third party app doesn't record the internal audio as it records only the video. Samsung should look into this feature asap and give an option to upgrade so that we can download the Screen recorder.- Samsung customer care is not very supportive as they simply say that someone will call from their back end team but you will receive any call from them.- I feel Samsung should have given more option while recording the video to add more Contrast, Brightness, Saturation etc so that the video looks rich like real 4K video.- Super Study option is of no use as it adds more grains in the video and it is better to shoot in normal mode.Overall a very good mobile for this price with amazing features.

Hanging problem, it will cry if we open camera after few months of use4. Charging time is way too much5. Most problematic: low network catching ability even in strong network availability6. Heavy, good exercise for you though7. Hard press on screen makes things work8. DONT BUY THIS CRAP...!

So that customer will surely be interested to give review because he knews the product well know plus you will be able to get honest customer review soo that if improvement is required can be done accordingly.

  I'm writing this review after an year of usage. No headphones, back cover or screen guard enclosed. No big camera clarity. Lot of heating issues. No good earpiece clarity when you listen to a call. My biggest problem found in this phone is, atleast once in a day when I insert my headphones into the audio port, there is a continuous annoying beep sound, which couldn't be stopped until you Restart or Switch off the device. Since I didn't want to go for Chinese Gadgets, I preferred this phone but feel for that now. Though I had used different models of Samsung Mobiles, Hope this may be my last purchase.

  Using it for a month now typicall samsung mobile. It's does feel special to me, it has that basic features that Samsung provide and say they are the best best but that are not. Annoying samsung own ads and notification. You should definitely uncheck terms and conditions for some user agreement while setting up the device be careful don't just click agree to all.It's good for daily drive and usage.Finger print is good no issues.Battery is good, can use it for 2 day with minimum usage and for the entire day with high media consumption.Camers are great from my perspective, I usually don't click that many pictures.Touch and sensitive is good, Display is Amoled so it's great.Speaker and call audio is average it's the main thing I dislike the most.Charging speed is ok as this one come with 15 watts charger so the charging sppen will be between 2 to 2.5 hours or more.Feels good, cheap plastic, easily scratches can be visible from day one if you are not careful.If you what to gift or buy this thing for your parents or spouse form normal media constitution it's the best thing you can give.Wahen Changing the font for the phone on the second day it freezes I had to restart the mobile to get this one working so ya typically Samsung mobile.The user interface is good samsung has come so far with designing a good UI, it feels really good.We could get more out of it but samsung don't want to give everything it just provide basic features or less features with high price even though the largest assembly/manufacturing plant is available in India.Could have been better but it's samsung so give them more money for less features for the sake of branding.

Great looks, sleek, sturdy, stylish, with an awesome display (SUPER AMOLED) that brings out the colours in vibrant hues. The fingerprint sensor is amazing and also the face unlock is nicely responsive. It has a powerful battery (6000 mAh) which runs quite long and has a fast charging 15W charger that fails to disappoint. 128 GB is more than sufficient for storage and the camera quality is decent but not great. Overall, a steal deal at this price and a must buy for people who are looking out for a Made in India phone.

Next day it started working. Again next day it worked and so is this problem  repeated.Due to pandemic the service  center denied and asked to come after covid is in control.This not only happened  with my phone but I can hear this issue from my friends too.Really  unhappy  with samsung m31

  There is no rating beyond one star. Writing this review after using one year. For first couple of month phone was good. Camera quality is good. Before two days back phone automatically got hanged and switched off while I was talking over phone. After that phone didn't started. Checked with Samsung care they are saying there is issue with motherboard, battery, charging board etc. And cost would be around 9500. So guys think before buying Samsung within a year 9.5k you have to pay for a 17k phone.!!! I am saying goodbye to Samsung! Better option is redmi using for 4.5 years no issue!

Amazon is playing with your needs & wants.. if they took an action earlier complaints & review another customer won't suffer.. it's really pathetic... Cam is not good.. slow charging.. taking more than 2.30 min for full charge..
