Abstract class can be inherited by the subclass and abstract method gets its definition in the subclass. Abstraction classes are meant to be the blueprint of the other class. An abstract class can be useful when we are designing large functions. An abstract class is also helpful to provide the standard interface for different implementations of components.

The ABC works by decorating methods of the base class as abstract. It registers concrete classes as the implementation of the abstract base. We use the @abstractmethod decorator to define an abstract method or if we don't provide the definition to the method, it automatically becomes the abstract method.
